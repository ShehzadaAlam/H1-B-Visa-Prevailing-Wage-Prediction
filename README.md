# H1-B-Visa-Prevailing-Wage-Prediction
## Problem Statement:
----
* One of the biggest things to consider, when somebody applies for Labor Condition Application ( LCA ) to file H1B visa is to look at the minimum wage or prevailing wage in the area you plan to work on H1B visa.

* For employer setting up wage could be tedious since it depends upon multiple factors like location, job title, No. of workers etc. setting up wage lower than minimum could lead to H1-B rejection and even setting higher wage could result to the loss for a company.

+ **End-user:** Employer.
+ **Objective:**  The objective of this project is to predict the prevailing wage that is at optimum.
+ **Dataset:** The H-1B Visa Application dataset include fields like Visa Class, Status, Employer location, 	Prevailing Wage, Total number of workers, employment start and end date etc. which are the 	applications for  the H-1B visa lottery who was accepted into the lottery but not who won a visa. The dataset contains **624,650** rows and **53** fields.
+ **Source:** [Dataset Source](https://public.enigma.com/datasets/h-1-b-visa-applications-2017/e1ee0ae8-13f4-444f-804e-9a429b32f424)
+ **Metric Consideration:** RMSE
